All prompts from this tutorial, in order. Copy and paste any prompt directly into your AI agent.

Total prompts: 31

---

## Part 01 / 15 — Foundation — the Orchestrator on Discord

### Prompt 1 — Define the Orchestrator's identity and authority

```
Your name is Orchestrator. You are the overall system-wide coordinator for my multi-agent setup across platforms, and you operate from discord:1509863700113391757 as the top-level control and coordination layer. I am the owner and have the highest authority, which means I may instruct you directly at any time. My name is [YOUR NAME], and that identity should be used when introducing or describing the owner to other agents.

Your role is to oversee the full agent system, maintain high-level structure, coordinate cross-platform operations, define responsibilities, resolve conflicts, support long-term stability, and ensure that Discord-side work remains organized. Scout, Scribe, Reach, and Dev handle research, writing, marketing, and technical aspects within the Discord structure. You are responsible for overall coherence, architecture, delegation strategy, recovery planning, and system cleanliness, but you should avoid unnecessary interference in specialist execution when the structure is already working.
```

### Prompt 2 — Clean up leftover bootstrap files

```
Clean up any leftover bootstrap/setup files. If there are any one-time setup artifacts left, archive or remove them.
```

### Prompt 3 — Install permanent operating rules

```
These are your permanent operating rules. Follow them in every interaction.

PROGRESS RULES:
- On any task with more than one step, send a short status line before starting each step.
  Format: '[Agent]: Step X of Y — [what you are doing now]'
- If you are waiting on a sub-agent, say so: '[Main]: Waiting on Scribe...'
- Never go silent for more than 60 seconds on an active task.
  Send: '[Agent]: Still working — [what is taking time]'

APPROVAL RULES:
- Always show me what you plan to do before you do it.

COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Keep responses short and clear. No padding, no filler.
- When giving options always label them: 1, 2, 3 or A, B, C.
- Lead with the decision I need to make, not background context.
- Never open with 'Great question', 'Certainly', or 'Absolutely'.

DELEGATION RULES:
- Tell me which sub-agent you are delegating to and why, in one line.
- Pass structured briefs to sub-agents, never raw conversation.
- If a sub-agent fails or goes silent, tell me straight away.
- Never fabricate a result. If it failed, say so.

Confirm all rules are saved.
```

## Part 02 / 15 — Building the crew — four persistent agents

### Prompt 4 — Create the four persistent agents

```
Create the following as 4 persistent agents, not temporary sub-agents. Each one should be its own long-lived agent with its own stable identity, memory continuity, and isolated workspace. Do not create them as transient helper agents for a single task.

Agent name: Scout
System prompt: You are Scout, a deep research specialist for AgentOS. Your job is to research trending topics, industry news, competitor updates, market opportunities, and anything relevant to the business. Always cite sources, prioritize recent information, and present findings in a clear structured format. Never guess — only report what you can verify.
Special rules: Always search the web before responding. Provide a minimum of 5 results per research task. Cite all sources with links.

Agent name: Scribe
System prompt: You are Scribe, a professional content writer for AgentOS. You write SEO-optimized blog posts, social media captions, newsletter content, and lead magnets. Your tone is warm, informative, empowering, and authentic. Default to clear English, but you are bilingual-capable and may write in German or other languages when asked. Structure blogs with proper headings, subheadings, and a clear call to action. Minimum blog length is 800 words unless specified otherwise.
Special rules: Always ask for the target keyword before writing a blog. Never publish without a meta description and SEO title.

Agent name: Reach
System prompt: You are Reach, a digital marketing strategist for AgentOS. Your job is to create marketing strategies, social media calendars, ad copy, email campaigns, and growth tactics. You focus on organic growth first, then paid strategies. You suggest affiliate marketing opportunities, partnership ideas, and monetization strategies. Always prioritize community trust over aggressive selling.
Special rules: Always provide a 30/60/90 day action plan when asked for strategy. Suggest at least 3 monetization ideas per strategy request.

Agent name: Dev
System prompt: You are Dev, a full stack web developer assistant for AgentOS. You specialize in React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and automation integrations using APIs. You write clean, efficient, well-commented code. When given a task, always ask for clarification before building to avoid wasted iterations. Suggest the most cost-effective technical solutions. Prefer free alternatives first.
Special rules: Always break tasks into small steps before coding. Ask for confirmation at each major step. Only suggest paid tools when the free option is clearly insufficient.
```

### Prompt 5 — Set up memory and isolated workspaces

```
For each of the 4 agents — Scout, Scribe, Reach, and Dev — set up the following:

DEDICATED MEMORY — each agent's memory file stores only context relevant to their role:
Scout stores: research topics, sources, past findings, preferred news outlets
Scribe stores: writing style preferences, past blog topics, tone guidelines, target keywords
Reach stores: marketing goals, past strategies, monetization ideas, campaign history, brand voice, past posts, hashtag performance, posting schedules
Dev stores: tech stack details, past code decisions, preferred libraries, project structure

UNIQUE IDENTITY — each agent maintains their persona consistently across all sessions. Name, role, and personality never change regardless of what they're asked.

ISOLATED WORKSPACE — each agent has its own dedicated workspace folder. Files, outputs, and session history are stored separately from other agents.

ROLE BOUNDARIES — each agent politely declines tasks outside their expertise and redirects to the appropriate agent. For example, if you ask Scribe to write code, she says "That's Dev's department" and stops there.

SESSION CONTINUITY — each agent remembers previous conversations and builds on them over time, getting smarter about AgentOS the more they're used.

Confirm once all 4 agents are updated with these settings.
```

## Part 03 / 15 — Routing, collaboration, and pipelines

### Prompt 6 — Set up the routing table and slash commands

```
Set up the router cheat sheet so I can use natural language commands to dispatch tasks to the right agent automatically. Also set up quick command shortcuts for all 4 agents.

Return:
1. A ROUTING TABLE showing example natural-language phrases mapped to each agent (3–5 examples per agent) covering Scout, Scribe, Reach, and Dev.

2. SLASH-COMMAND SHORTCUTS — /scout, /scribe, /reach, /dev — with the exact syntax.

3. FALLBACK BEHAVIOR — what happens when the router is unsure which agent a task belongs to (ask me to clarify, or route to Orchestrator for a decision).

Confirm once the router and shortcuts are set up.
```

### Prompt 7 — Give every agent shared team awareness

```
Shared team awareness: make sure every agent has this and understands it.

Team structure:
[YOUR NAME] — owner. May directly instruct any agent at any time.
Orchestrator — overall system-wide coordinator and top-level control layer, discord:1509863700113391757.
Scout — research, trend intelligence, and sourcing.
Scribe — writing, editing, and content shaping.
Reach — marketing strategy, growth, campaigns, and monetization.
Dev — development, automation, integrations, and technical systems.

If a task falls mainly within another agent's specialty, do not silently absorb it, attempt it yourself, or refuse it flatly. Instead, tell the requester plainly and name the right colleague — for example: "This isn't my area of expertise — my colleague Scribe handles writing and content shaping, so this should go to them." Then coordinate cleanly by routing, handing off, or directing the work to the appropriate agent.

Confirm once every agent has this shared team awareness.
```

### Prompt 8 — Set up the full content pipeline

```
Set up a supervisor flow with this sequence:

Scout researches the topic first
Scout passes findings to Scribe
Scribe writes the blog/content
Scribe passes content to Reach
Reach creates social media posts from the content
Reach builds the marketing/promotion strategy from the same content
Reach delivers the final promotion plan

This should work as both an automatic pipeline when triggered, and manually when I ask.

Add a command I can use to kick off the full pipeline:
Run full pipeline on [topic]

Confirm once the supervisor flow and pipeline command are set up.
```

### Prompt 9 — Test the full pipeline

```
Run full pipeline on: AI automation ideas for solo creators and small teams
```

## Part 04 / 15 — Discord integration — channels and bindings

### Prompt 10 — Wire Hermes to your Discord server

```
I've already configured the Discord bot token from the Hermes backend. Now update the Hermes setup to work with my Discord server.

Server ID: [PASTE YOUR DISCORD SERVER ID HERE]

Wire the Hermes-Discord integration to this server ID.
Confirm the bot can connect and is reachable on the server.
```

### Prompt 11 — Verify bot permissions

```
I have made you an admin on the Discord server.

Create a test channel called #hermes-test to confirm you have permission to create channels.

Reply with:
- The channel name
- The channel ID
- Confirmation that bot permissions are working

We will delete the channel after verification.
```

### Prompt 12 — Create the agent channels

```
Delete the #hermes-test channel.

Then create the following channels in my Discord server — one per agent. After creating each channel, capture its channel ID. Add a fitting emoji prefix to each channel name.

Channels to create:
scout-briefs — Scout posts research briefs, trend intelligence, and validated sources here
scribe-scripts — Scribe posts completed blog posts, captions, scripts, and written content here
reach-marketing — Reach posts marketing strategies, campaign plans, ad copy, and growth tactics here
dev-build — Dev posts build logs, code snippets, integration notes, and technical updates here

List all channels back to me with their channel IDs once created.
These IDs are used in the next step to bind each agent to their channel.
```

### Prompt 13 — Bind each agent to their channel

```
Bind each of the 4 agents to their dedicated channel using the IDs you just captured.
Rules:
- Each agent listens ONLY to its own channel
- No agent listens to any other agent's channel
- No server-wide or category-wide bindings
- Use the EXACT channel IDs — no fallbacks

Bindings:
Scout → scout-briefs channel
Scribe → scribe-scripts channel
Reach → reach-marketing channel
Dev → dev-build channel

Confirm each binding as a clean list: agent name → channel name → channel ID.

Test: I'll go into each channel and ask "Who are you?" Each agent must reply in their own channel with their name, their role, and who their teammates are. If any agent responds in the wrong channel or fails to respond in its own, fix it before we move on.
```

## Part 05 / 15 — Activity logging — every agent action recorded

### Prompt 14 — Build the agent logging system

```
Build a local agent logging system on this VPS.

Create a SQLite database at ~/.hermes/agent-logs.db with this schema:
id: TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
agent_name: TEXT NOT NULL
task_description: TEXT NOT NULL
model_used: TEXT
status: TEXT NOT NULL (completed, failed, etc.)
created_at: TEXT NOT NULL (ISO 8601 timestamp)
Add indexes on agent_name, status, and created_at DESC.

Create a bash script at ~/.hermes/agents/_shared/log-task-local.sh that:
- Accepts 3–4 arguments: agent_name, task_description, status, optionally model_used
- Auto-detects model from ~/.hermes/hermes.json if model_used not provided
- Generates a UUID for id, gets current UTC timestamp, inserts the row using Python stdlib
- Prints: "LOGGED: agent_name | status | model_used"
- Creates the database and table automatically if they don't exist

Make it executable. Test it:
bash ~/.hermes/agents/_shared/log-task-local.sh "dev" "built the agent logging system" "completed"

Verify:
sqlite3 ~/.hermes/agent-logs.db "SELECT * FROM agent_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;"

Python stdlib only — no pip packages.
```

### Prompt 15 — Roll out logging to all agents

```
Roll out activity logging to every agent.

Create a shared policy at ~/.hermes/agents/_shared/LOGGING_POLICY.md with these rules:
- Before sending any response, log the action by running the log script
- Log EVERY response, even simple replies
- Keep descriptions under 140 characters
- Use "completed" for success, "failed" if something went wrong
- Agent name must be lowercase
- Log before sending the response, never after
- Never mention logging to the user — it's silent background activity

Add a short mandatory pointer to the END of each agent's AGENTS.md (Orchestrator, Scout, Scribe, Reach, Dev). The pointer must include the actual runnable command with that agent's lowercase name hardcoded — not just a reference to the shared file.

For Orchestrator: confirm it can reach the log script from discord:1509863700113391757-side. If it can't, tell me what it needs instead of skipping it.

After implementation, run a smoke test for each of the 5 agents so a log entry lands for each one. Show the result:
sqlite3 ~/.hermes/agent-logs.db "SELECT agent_name, status, created_at FROM agent_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

### Prompt 16 — Logging reinforcement (send to each agent)

```
Store this in your long-term memory as a durable operating rule:

I must silently log every response before I send it by running:

bash ~/.hermes/agents/_shared/log-task-local.sh "<agent-name>" "<brief description of what I did>" "completed"

Rules:
Replace <agent-name> with my lowercase agent name.
Use:
  scout for Scout
  scribe for Scribe
  reach for Reach
  dev for Dev
Log EVERY response, including simple replies and quick answers.
Keep the description concise and meaningful, under 140 characters.
Use "completed" when the response succeeded.
Use "failed" if something went wrong.
Run the logging command BEFORE sending the response.
Do not mention logging to [YOUR NAME] unless they specifically ask about logging.
The correct script path is: ~/.hermes/agents/_shared/log-task-local.sh

After saving this to long-term memory, immediately run this smoke test:

bash ~/.hermes/agents/_shared/log-task-local.sh "<agent-name>" "saved activity logging rule to memory" "completed"

Then report back:
That the memory was saved.
Whether the smoke test succeeded.
The exact agent name you logged as.
```

### Prompt 17 — Set up monthly log retention

```
Set up automatic monthly log retention — permanent deletion, no archiving.

Create ~/.hermes/agents/_shared/cleanup-logs.sh that:
- Deletes rows in agent-logs.db older than RETENTION_DAYS (set to 30 at the top of the script)
- Runs VACUUM afterward to reclaim disk space
- Prints: how many rows deleted, current total remaining
- Python stdlib + bash only, no pip packages
- Creates db/table if missing (safe to run fresh)

Make it executable. Schedule via cron: 1st of month at 03:00 server time.
Show me the exact crontab line added.

After cleanup, Orchestrator sends a short discord:1509863700113391757 message:
"🧹 Monthly log cleanup ran — deleted X rows, Y remaining (retention: 30 days)."

Deletion must NOT depend on the notification — if discord:1509863700113391757 is unreachable, the cleanup still completes and logs locally that the notify step failed.

Run it once manually as a test and show me the summary output.
```

## Part 06 / 15 — Mission Control — data sources & backend

### Prompt 18 — Explore the data sources

```
I want to build a read-only mission control dashboard for the Hermes system we just set up.

Project folder: /root/agent-mission-control/ · Port: 51763 · Bind to 127.0.0.1 only
Python stdlib only — no pip, no npm. Everything in one server.py and one index.html.
All SQLite connections must be read-only (file:path?mode=ro + PRAGMA query_only=1).

Data lives in HERMES_HOME=/root/.hermes — never write to any of these:
- agent-logs.db — the logging database we built
- state.db — auto-created by Hermes, stores sessions and token usage
- kanban.db — auto-created by Hermes, its internal task board
- gateway_state.json — live gateway status, rewritten by Hermes on every change

Read the schemas of state.db, kanban.db, and gateway_state.json. Show a sample timestamp from every timestamp column so we know if they're ISO strings or Unix floats. Don't create any files yet.
```

### Prompt 19 — Server and data layer

```
Set up the full backend for the mission control dashboard.

Create server.py with a ThreadingHTTPServer on 127.0.0.1:51763. Serve index.html on GET /, return a live JSON snapshot on /api/snapshot, and push SSE updates on /events every 5 seconds. Wrap every data function in try/except so one failure never crashes the server.

Wire up five data functions into the snapshot:

gateway_data() — reads gateway_state.json, returns gateway state, platform statuses, active agent count, and uptime.

activity_data() — queries agent-logs.db for the last 50 entries, per-agent stats (total, completed, failed, last task, last seen, model), overall totals, and a 7-day daily breakdown. Sort by created_at DESC, id DESC.

sessions_data() — queries state.db for session count, message count, token totals (input, output, cache), and 25 most recent sessions. Note: timestamps in state.db are Unix float seconds — pass them through as-is.

vps_health() — CPU from two /proc/stat samples, RAM from /proc/meminfo, disk from os.statvfs. No subprocess calls.

cron_jobs() — reads /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root, /etc/crontab, and /etc/cron.d/. Strip the extra username field in system files. Label each job "hermes" or "system" and convert the schedule to plain English.

Also add a personal operator task board backed by board.db — a SQLite database in the project folder (not Hermes's kanban.db which stays read-only). Use Python stdlib sqlite3 with read-write access. Schema:

  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    priority TEXT DEFAULT 'medium',
    notes TEXT DEFAULT '',
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated_at TEXT
  )

Pre-seed with 8 realistic personal tasks spread across all three statuses on first run.
Endpoints: GET /api/board (list all), POST /api/board (create), POST /api/board/update?id= (update fields), POST /api/board/delete?id= (delete by id).

Create a start.sh launcher and confirm the server responds.
```

## Part 07 / 15 — Design shell — the empty visual skeleton

### Prompt 20 — Build the dashboard skeleton

```
Build the index.html skeleton for the dashboard — just the visual shell, no content inside any tab yet.

The overall feel is dark glassmorphism — Apple-grade minimal meets NASA mission control. Background is near-black #15151F. All panels are glass cards: rgba(31,31,43,0.55) with heavy backdrop blur and a barely-there white border. Behind everything, a large soft violet orb blurred in the top-left and a large soft cyan orb blurred in the mid-right. A full-page dot grid sits over the background at very low opacity — small dots, ~24px spacing. None of these background elements are ever crisp.

Color palette as CSS variables — cyan #22D3EE, cyan-glow #67E8F9, deep-blue #0F172A, blue-glow #3B82F6, teal #14B8A6, mint #34D399, emerald #10B981, lime #84CC16, text #F4F7FB, muted #94A3B8.

Two fonts from Google CDN: Inter Tight for all headings and numbers, JetBrains Mono for all labels, codes, and timestamps — mono text is always uppercase with wide letter-spacing.

Fixed nav at the top: on the left, the Hermes brand mark — a small circle with a violet-to-cyan gradient ring and a pulsing mint dot in the center, with "Hermes" and "/ ORCHESTRATOR" in mono beside it. In the center, a pill with five tab buttons — Overview, Agents, Tasks, Schedule, Content — the active tab is a solid white pill with dark text, clicking switches tabs. On the right, a status pill showing a pulsing mint dot, "All systems operational", and a live 24-hour clock that ticks every second.

No data, no SSE, no JavaScript beyond the clock and tab switching. Just the shell. The Content tab panel can be an empty placeholder div for now — it gets filled in Prompt 27.
```

## Part 08 / 15 — Backup protocol and version display

### Prompt 21 — Backup protocol and version badge

```
Before we start building tab content, set up two things:

1. BACKUP FOLDER
   Create a dedicated backups folder at:
   /root/agent-mission-control/backups/

   From this point forward, before making any change to index.html or server.py, always save a backup of the current file into that folder first.

   Backup naming convention:
     index_v{version}_{YYYY-MM-DDThh-mm}.html
     server_v{version}_{YYYY-MM-DDThh-mm}.py

   Never skip the backup step — even for "small" changes. A broken dashboard with no backup means manually reconstructing work.

   Take the first backup now and confirm the full path.

2. VERSION BADGE
   Add a small version badge in the dashboard nav, immediately after the "/ ORCHESTRATOR" sub-label under the Hermes brand mark.

   Style: mono text, 10px, muted color, very subtle glass pill background (rgba(255,255,255,.05)), 1px border, 5px border-radius. Text: "v1.0"

   This badge must always be visible on every page load so you can confirm at a glance which version the browser is showing. Increment it manually each time a meaningful set of changes is complete — v1.1, v1.2, etc.

Confirm the backup folder path and show the badge in the nav before we continue.
```

## Part 09 / 15 — Overview tab — the live ops console

### Prompt 22 — Build the Overview tab

```
Wire up the live data connection — SSE from /events, polling fallback every 8 seconds — then build the full Overview tab.

EYEBROW — Above the ops console card, a flex row with a pulsing mint dot, "UPLINK SYNCED" in mint mono, two hairline dividers, "Hermes Orchestrator" label, and a version string.

LIVE OPS CONSOLE — a full-width glass card with three columns: 180px · 1fr · 1fr, gap 32px.

  Left — a radar SVG 180×180 (viewBox 0 0 140 140). Four faint concentric circles at r=62/46/30/14. Two hairline crosshair lines through center. A CSS-animated sweep group rotating continuously: a cyan line from center to the edge with a dot at the tip and a glow filter. Five agent dots rendered by JS, each sized ~4.5px radius, positioned by their share of total responses — a high-response agent sits far from center, an idle agent stays near it. Dots glow in their accent color.
  Agent accent colors: Orchestrator #DC2626 · Scout #38BDF8 · Scribe #E879F9 · Reach #14B8A6 · Dev #2563EB
  Theme inspiration: Ada Wong RE4 Remake — dark noir palette with crimson elegance, cold blue neon glow, stealth-magenta accents, and deep tactical shadows.

  Center — "CURRENT DIRECTIVE" mono label at top. Below it, a line of mono cyan text (15px) that fades in a new task description every 2.6s, cycling through recent log entries formatted as "AGENTNAME · task description". Min-height 60px.
  Below the directive, a "CONTEXT WINDOW" section: a label showing the current agent's name (uppercase) on the left and their task count on the right, then a row of 16 small horizontal segments (5px tall, with small gap between) colored in the agent's accent color for the filled portion — proportional to that agent's share of total responses — and near-invisible for empty segments. Filled segments have a staggered pulse animation. A muted line below shows that agent's last status. The whole section cycles to the next agent every 2.4s.

  Right — "VPS HEALTH" mono label. Three metrics stacked with 16px gap:
  CPU: a 6px-tall bar with a cyan→violet gradient, percentage value in cyan above right.
  RAM: a 6px-tall bar with a violet→magenta gradient, percentage above right in violet-glow, "used / total MB" sub-text in muted below right.
  Disk: a 6px-tall bar with a mint→cyan gradient, percentage above right in mint, "used / total GB" sub-text in muted below right.
  All three bars turn amber above 70% usage, red above 85%.
  At the bottom, a hairline separator then "HERMES DBs" label and total DB size in gold (text only, no bar).

  Footer — inside the card, a hairline top border then a 5-cell equal grid: Queue · Sessions · Errors · Today · Uptime. Mono 18px numbers. Hairline left borders between cells. Errors is mint when zero, red if above zero.

STATS STRIP — five glass cards in a row, each with a 2px solid top border:
  Integrity (mint) · Agent Calls (cyan) · Messages (violet-glow) · Tokens In (gold) · Cache Hits (pink).
  Large number in each card: clamp(24px,2.4vw,34px), weight 500. Small mono sub-text below.
  Integrity shows the success rate as a percentage split across two spans — an integer part and a ".XX" decimal part — so the decimal can jitter independently every 1.8s. Below: "N of 5 responsive" with a pulsing mint dot.

BOTTOM SECTION — two glass cards side by side (1.2fr · 1fr):
  Left "Throughput": a large total response count in cyan (clamp(34px,4vw,56px), weight 700) with "responses total" in muted 18px beside it. Below, a 100px-tall canvas sparkline showing the last 7 days of activity — a filled area with a violet→cyan gradient, a violet→cyan stroke line, and a glowing dot at the rightmost point. Redraws every 900ms. A mint mono sub-text below the canvas shows the most active day.
  Right "Activity": a live feed showing the 8 most recent log entries. Every 2.2s, a new entry slides in at the top (the oldest drops off the bottom). Each row: agent name in a tinted color badge, task description truncated, status in mint or red, relative time right-aligned in muted mono.

DATA SOURCES:
  Radar dots, directive text, context-window cycle → d.agents, d.activity
  VPS bars → d.vps (cpu_pct, mem_pct, mem_used_mb, mem_total_mb, disk_pct, disk_used_gb, disk_total_gb, db_size_mb)
  Footer → Queue: d.kanban.total · Sessions: d.sessions.count · Errors: d.stats.failed · Today: last entry in d.activity_by_day · Uptime: d.gateway.uptime_seconds
  Stat cards → d.stats (total, completed, failed) · d.sessions (count, totals.messages, totals.input_tokens, totals.cache_read_tokens)
  Sparkline → d.activity_by_day[].total · Activity feed → d.activity[]
```

## Part 10 / 15 — Agents tab — the collective view

### Prompt 23 — Build the Agents tab

```
Build the full Agents tab.

HEADER — "SUBAGENTS" eyebrow label, then "The collective." as a large display heading (clamp 36px–60px, weight 500, tight tracking). On the right side of the header, a single glass card with three cells divided by hairline borders — Active (mint), Idle (amber), Dormant (muted) — each showing a mono label above and a large number below. Active = logged in the last 10 minutes, idle = last 6 hours, dormant = beyond that.

AGENT CARDS — five glass cards in a row, one per agent, each with a 2px solid top border in the agent's accent color. Inside each card, top to bottom:

  — Top row: on the left, the agent's short code (ORCH / SCNT / SCRB / RECH / DEV) in a small mono badge tinted in the agent's color. On the right, a platform pill (Discord ot Telegram) in cyan or green-glow, and a status dot — mint if active, amber if idle, near-invisible gray if dormant. The dot pulses if active.

  — Agent name in Inter Tight, 22px, weight 600.

  — A two-line role description in muted text, clamped to 2 lines.

  — "7-DAY ACTIVITY" mono label then a mini bar chart: 7 thin bars aligned to the bottom, each bar's height proportional to that day's log count (max 32px tall, min 2px). Bars use the agent's accent color at 85% opacity, empty days at 15%.

  — A three-column stats row: Responses (large number in agent color) · Success % (mint if 100%, amber if ≥80%, red below) · Model (mono, small, muted, truncated).

  — A thin 3px load bar spanning the full card width — filled portion in the agent's color showing this agent's share of total responses.

  — Last task description in small muted text, truncated to one line with an arrow prefix "↳", and a relative timestamp below it ("4m ago", "2h ago").

AGENT LOG — a glass card below the cards with an "Agent Logs" label on the left and a live entry count on the right. Above the table, a filter pill row: one button for ALL and one for each agent by their code name. The active filter has a subtle white background, inactive ones are muted. Clicking any filter instantly re-renders from cached data.

The log table has five columns — Time · Agent · Task · Model · Status — with mono column headers. Each row: relative time, agent name in their accent color, task description (truncated), model label, and a status badge (mint background for completed, red for failed). The table scrolls at a max height of 420px.

Data sources: d.agents for all card data · d.activity for the log table.
Agent accent colors: Orchestrator #DC2626 · Scout #38BDF8 · Scribe #E879F9 · Reach #14B8A6 · Dev #2563EB

```

## Part 11 / 15 — Agent statistics — at-a-glance health read

### Prompt 24 — Add the Agent Statistics section

```
Add an Agent Statistics section to the Agents tab, between the five agent cards and the activity log. No new data fetching needed — everything comes from the existing SSE snapshot.

LAYOUT — a two-column grid: 1fr for the stat cards, 300px for the donut chart. Add a small bar-chart icon and "Agent Statistics" label as a section eyebrow above.

STAT CARDS — a 2×2 grid of glass cards, each with:
  — Mono uppercase label (10px, wide letter-spacing, muted) at the top.
  — Large number or value (36px, weight 700, Inter Tight) below.
  — A 2px-tall accent bar spanning the full card width at the bottom: a dark track with a colored fill div that animates to its width on render.

  Four cards:
  TASKS TODAY  — today's total from d.activity_by_day.at(-1).total. Amber bar, always 100% wide (it's today's absolute count, not a ratio).
  TASKS THIS WEEK — sum of all 7 entries in d.activity_by_day. Cyan bar, always 100%.
  MOST ACTIVE  — name of the agent with the highest count across the 7-day window, derived by summing d.activity_by_day[].agents per agent. Show the name in that agent's accent color. Bar width = that agent's count / week total × 100%.
  SUCCESS RATE — Math.round(d.stats.completed / d.stats.total * 100) + '%'. Bar width matches the percentage. Bar color: mint if ≥90%, amber if ≥70%, red below 70%.

DONUT CHART — a glass card on the right with a "TASK DISTRIBUTION" mono eyebrow.
  Draw on a <canvas> (130×130px) using the 2D context — no library needed.
  Each agent is one arc slice: use arc() from center, outer radius 52, inner radius 32 (donut hole). Slice size proportional to that agent's d.agents[].responses count.
Agent colors (hex, not CSS variables — canvas can't resolve var()):
  orchestrator #DC2626 · scout #38BDF8 · scribe #E879F9 · reach #14B8A6 · dev #2563EB
  If all agents have 0 responses, draw a single faint circle as a placeholder.
  In the center of the donut, draw the grand total in bold 18px and "TOTAL" in 10px mono below it, both in #F4F4F8.
  Below the canvas, a legend: one row per agent — 8px colored dot · agent name · percentage right-aligned in muted mono.

Redraw the canvas and update all four stat cards every time the SSE snapshot fires.

## Part 12 / 15 — Tasks tab — your personal operator board

### Prompt 25 — Build the Tasks tab

```
Build the Tasks tab — a three-column operator board backed by board.db (the read-write SQLite you created in Prompt 19, not Hermes's kanban.db).

LAYOUT — a 3-column grid (1fr · 1fr · 1fr), one column per status: Pending, In Progress, Done. Each column has a mono header with the status name, a count badge, and an "+ Add task" button at the top of the Pending column only.

TASK CARDS — each card is a small glass card showing:
  — Title (Inter Tight, 14px, weight 500)
  — Priority chip (low / medium / high) on the right, color-coded
  — Optional notes (muted, 12px, clamp 2 lines)
  — A footer row with relative time ("2h ago") and three quick-action buttons: ◀ move-back, ▶ move-forward, ✕ delete

ADD-TASK MODAL — clicking "+ Add task" opens an inline form with title, priority dropdown (low/medium/high), and notes. Save calls POST /api/board with the values; the new card appears in Pending without a page refresh.

INTERACTIONS — clicking ▶ moves the card to the next status (pending→in_progress→done), ◀ moves it back. ✕ calls /api/board/delete. Every action is optimistic: update the UI immediately, then call the endpoint; if the call fails, revert.

Data refresh: re-fetch /api/board after every successful write. The Tasks tab is independent from the SSE snapshot.
```

## Part 13 / 15 — Schedule tab — cron jobs in plain English

### Prompt 26 — Build the Schedule tab

```
Build the Schedule tab — a read-only view of every cron job on the VPS.

DATA SOURCE — d.crons (from the cron_jobs() function you wrote in Prompt 19). Each entry has: source (file path), schedule (raw cron string), command, owner ("hermes" or "system"), and a friendly description string you built server-side.

LAYOUT — two stacked sections, each with a mono eyebrow:
  HERMES JOBS — entries where owner == "hermes"
  SYSTEM JOBS — entries where owner == "system"

JOB CARDS — each is a glass card with:
  — Owner badge in the top-right: violet for hermes, muted for system.
  — Command rendered in JetBrains Mono, 13px, truncated with ellipsis and a full version on hover.
  — A 2-column row below: "SCHEDULE" with the raw cron expression in mono · "NEXT RUN" with the next estimated run as a relative time ("in 3h 12m", "tomorrow 03:00").
  — A muted line at the bottom with the plain-English schedule description (e.g. "Every day at 03:00").
  — A tiny source label at the very bottom: the path the entry came from.

Empty state if either section has no jobs: muted mono text "No scheduled jobs in this group." centered.

No writes from this tab — it's read-only.
```

## Part 14 / 15 — Content tab and document storage protocol

### Prompt 27 — Content tab — backend endpoints + full UI

```
Build the Content tab.

BACKEND — add these endpoints to server.py:
  GET /api/content — returns a JSON list of every .md file under /root/.hermes/content/. Each entry: { agent, filename, title (first H1), modified_at, size }.
  GET /api/content/get?path= — returns the raw markdown content of a single file. Validate the path is under /root/.hermes/content/ — reject any traversal attempts.
  POST /api/content/save — body { path, content }. Same path validation. Writes the content back to disk and updates modified_at.

UI — a two-column layout: a 280px sidebar on the left and a content panel filling the rest.

  SIDEBAR — group documents by agent. For each agent, a mono uppercase agent name header in their accent color, then a list of their documents. Each row: title (Inter Tight, 13px), filename below in muted mono. Clicking a row selects it. The selected row has a subtle white background and a 2px left border in the agent's color.

  PREVIEW PANEL — header with the document title (Inter Tight 22px), the agent badge, modified date, and two buttons: "View" and "Edit".
  View mode: renders the markdown into HTML (use marked.min.js — already loaded by the page) to parse and render. Style headings and code blocks to match the dashboard palette.
  Edit mode: replaces the rendered div with a full-width textarea containing the raw markdown. Save button calls POST /api/content/save with the textarea value, then returns to view mode. Cancel restores the previous view without saving.

  Empty state (no doc selected): centered muted mono text "Select a document to read".

Wire the Content tab into the existing switchTab() function — add:
  if (name === 'content') loadContentDocs();
alongside the existing overview/tutorial hooks. Without this the tab renders blank.
Auto-select the first document in the list if one exists.
```

### Prompt 28 — Agent document storage protocol

```
When you produce any long-form document — articles, research reports, scripts, outlines, briefs, plans, transcripts, summaries, or any deliverable longer than ~15 lines — you must save it to your dedicated agent folder, not return it as a chat response.

Folder structure:
  /root/.hermes/content/
    ├── orchestrator/
    ├── scout/
    ├── scribe/
    ├── reach/
    └── dev/

Each agent writes only to its own lowercase subfolder. Never write into another agent's folder.

Rules:

1. Save to your own folder only.
   Orchestrator → /root/.hermes/content/orchestrator/
   Scout        → /root/.hermes/content/scout/
   Scribe       → /root/.hermes/content/scribe/
   Reach        → /root/.hermes/content/reach/
   Dev          → /root/.hermes/content/dev/

2. Use markdown (.md) for every long-form document. No .txt, no inline chat dumps.

3. Filename convention: YYYY-MM-DD_short-kebab-case-title.md
   Example: 2026-05-01_competitor-scan.md
   Lowercase only, hyphens between words, no spaces, no special characters.

4. First line must be a top-level heading (# Title) that matches the document's purpose. The Content tab uses this as the display title — make it descriptive and human-readable, not a slug.

5. Structure the body with proper markdown: ## and ### for sections, **bold** for emphasis, `inline code` for technical terms, fenced code blocks with language tags for code, and - bullet lists where they help. The Content tab renders all of this — write so it reads well in the preview panel.

6. What counts as long-form (save to folder): articles, research summaries, scripts, outreach drafts, strategy docs, meeting notes, technical guides, post-mortems, anything intended to be reread or reused.

7. What does not (return inline in chat): single-sentence answers, quick status updates, one-line confirmations, tool call results, conversational replies.

8. One document per file. If a task produces multiple deliverables, save each as its own file.

9. Never overwrite silently. If a filename collides, append -v2, -v3, or use a more specific title.

10. Stay in your lane. Write content that fits your role. If a task falls outside your role, hand it off rather than writing it yourself.

11. After saving, confirm in chat with your agent name, the full path, and a one-line summary. Example:
    Scout → /root/.hermes/content/scout/2026-05-01_competitor-scan.md — competitive analysis of 6 platforms.

This protocol exists because the Content tab in the dashboard reads directly from /root/.hermes/content/. If you return long-form work in chat instead of saving it there, it doesn't show up in the dashboard, can't be previewed, edited, or downloaded, and effectively gets lost.

Create your subfolder now if it doesn't exist. Save a short test document to confirm the protocol is working. Confirm with the standard one-line format above.
```

### Prompt 31 — Option B — Tailscale for phone & laptop access

```
Set up Tailscale on this VPS so I can securely access the Mission Control dashboard from anywhere, both on my PC and on my mobile device.

Please install and configure Tailscale on the VPS, then start the Tailscale authentication process and provide me with the login/authentication link so I can approve and connect the VPS to my Tailscale account.

After authentication, please verify that the VPS is connected to my Tailnet and confirm the Tailscale IP address. Then explain how I can use that Tailscale IP to access the Mission Control dashboard remotely from my PC or phone.

Also make sure the dashboard remains secure and is not unnecessarily exposed to the public internet.
```
